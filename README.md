# Data Structures

### Overview
This repo documents my journey through studying data structures, one of the most important topics in computer science. I've consumed a lot of content and solved a bunch of problems, and I created this list to track my progress, so I appreciate this list. It has helped me understand complex topics clearly because the challenges gradually become harder. You can search for a problem name, and you will find various coding sites discussing it, even if there's no online judge available.

### Resources

There are many well-known courses that provide comprehensive content and clear explanations. I personally used various resources and switched between them smoothly, but I recommend sticking with one to maintain focus and consistency. Below are two excellent resources that have guided me:

- [Data Structures - Berkely](https://sp21.datastructur.es/)
- [Algorithms Part I - Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
