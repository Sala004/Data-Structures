# Data Structures

### Overview
In this repo, I'm tracking my progress on my journey to learn and master data structures, and I'm also sharing my solutions with others.

### Resources

There are many well-known courses that provide comprehensive content and clear explanations. I personally used various resources and switched between them smoothly, but I recommend sticking with one to maintain focus and consistency. Below are two excellent resources that have guided me:

- [Data Structures - Berkely](https://sp21.datastructur.es/)
- [Algorithms Part I - Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
